# Automated Tests
This directory holds code for any automated tests run to test the infaustructure after a release.

* [api-test-manager.py:](/tests/api-test-manager.py) This python script sends off requests to each API deployed to AWS, and tests basic scenarios. This automated testing was in early beta and is lightly duplicated and would have been refined before being put into regular use, ideally.
